# Drought-and-Conflict
Stata code and data for  replicating analyses presented in: Williford, George W. 2017. "Drought and the Militarization of International River Disputes." Working paper.

## Project Description
How does the onset of drought influence the management of international river disputes? Previous research has found that states with arid climates are more likely to use force over river disputes. However, scholars have yet to examine the effect of below-average precipitation effect the use of force.  I argue that short-term dry spells, or droughts, represent acute crises that may substantially disrupt states' ability to use river water. In doing so, they may enhance the willingness of states with international disputes over the proper use of river water to use force to coerce their opponents into complying with their demands. I test this argument using data on river claims from the Issue Correlates of War project. I find that countries experiencing below average rainfall in a given year are more likely to use force over a river claim. I also find that this effect is stronger for states that have arid climates. In addition, the probability of conflict decreases the longer a state remains in a period of drought, suggesting that states adapt to new levels of water availability over time.
